{"html":"<p>Welcome to the first post in my Blog!</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-start-a-blog\">Why start a blog?</h2>\n<p>I want to start a blog because I want to have a place to call my own on the internet. A place where I can do whatever I like. It&#39;s a place to share things I&#39;ve learnt, things I&#39;ve done or things that I think are interesting. In a longer and more flexible format than a twitter account.</p>\n<p>As an engineer a handmade blog is especially exciting because it&#39;s something which I can craft using the skills of my trade. It&#39;s sort of like a personal workshop. It&#39;s a place where I can practice my craft, hone my skills, or experiment and try out new things. There are no consequences, no customers, no deadlines.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-single-journey-starts-with-one-step\">A single journey starts with one step</h2>\n<p>When I decided to start a blog I had high hopes for it&#39;s hosting and design. Like I said, it&#39;s a playground! I wanted everything handmade. A micro-cms, full hosting (think S3, mongoDB, lambda) a lightweight frontend, markdown rendering, all rolled up with snazzy CI etc etc...</p>\n<p>I messed around with this for a few weeks before realising I&#39;d lost sight of what I was doing. Most importantly, I wanted a blog. My wildly ambitious spec requirements were distracting me and I was no closer to having somewhere to actually write. I decided to get an MVP up and work on it from there.</p>\n<p>Version 1 is a lightly adjusted <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">hugo</a> template (<a href=\"https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-basic/\">hugo-theme-basic</a>) hosted with <a href=\"https://render.com/\">render.com</a>. Getting it up and running was a handful of commands.</p>\n<p>[EDIT] <em>Version 2 is now up! You&#39;re looking at it!</em></p>\n<p><em>V2 is designed and written by me using <a href=\"https://svelte.dev\">Svelte</a>. Svelte is a lightweight frontend js framework which promises lots of the features found in other frameworks like React.js or Vue, at a fraction of the build size, whilst providing better speed and reactivity to the end user.</em></p>\n<p><em>I like things which are small, simple and effective. Which is why I like svelte, and why I chose it for my site.</em></p>\n<p><em>The source code can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/benmcgarvey/benmcgarveysvelte\">here</a>.</em></p>\n","metadata":{"title":"The First Post","date":"2019-09-04T02:00:00+10:00","edited":"2019-11-28T00:48:00+10:00","draft":"false","metaDescription":"Why should you start a blog as a Software Engineer?
