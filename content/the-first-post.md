Welcome to the first post in my Blog!

## Why start a blog?

I want to start a blog because I want to have a place to call my own on the internet. A place where I can do whatever I like. It's a place to share things I've learnt, things I've done or things that I think are interesting. In a longer and more flexible format than a twitter account.

As an engineer a handmade blog is especially exciting because it's something which I can craft using the skills of my trade. It's sort of like a personal workshop. It's a place where I can practice my craft, hone my skills, or experiment and try out new things. There are no consequences, no customers, no deadlines.

## A single journey starts with one step

When I decided to start a blog I had high hopes for it's hosting and design. Like I said, it's a playground! I wanted everything handmade. A micro-cms, full hosting (think S3, mongoDB, lambda) a lightweight frontend, markdown rendering, all rolled up with snazzy CI etc etc...

I messed around with this for a few weeks before realising I'd lost sight of what I was doing. Most importantly, I wanted a blog. My wildly ambitious spec requirements were distracting me and I was no closer to having somewhere to actually write. I decided to get an MVP up and work on it from there.

Version 1 is a lightly adjusted [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) template ([hugo-theme-basic](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-basic/)) hosted with [render.com](https://render.com/). Getting it up and running was a handful of commands.

[EDIT] _Version 2 is now up! You're looking at it!_

_V2 is designed and written by me using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). Svelte is a lightweight frontend js framework which promises lots of the features found in other frameworks like React.js or Vue, at a fraction of the build size, whilst providing better speed and reactivity to the end user._

_I like things which are small, simple and effective. Which is why I like svelte, and why I chose it for my site._
